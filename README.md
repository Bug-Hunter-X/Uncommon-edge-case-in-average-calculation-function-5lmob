# Python Average Calculation with Edge Case Handling

This repository demonstrates a seemingly simple Python function to calculate the average of a list of numbers and highlights an uncommon edge case related to handling empty lists and lists containing zeros. The `bug.py` file contains the function with a potential issue, while `bugSolution.py` provides the corrected implementation.

The key takeaway is that even simple functions need careful consideration of edge cases to prevent unexpected behavior or errors.
